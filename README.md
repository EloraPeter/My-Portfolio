💼 My Portfolio Welcome to my portfolio — a comprehensive collection of the work I’ve done as a Software Engineering student, Frontend Developer, and Tech Educator. This portfolio highlights not just the websites I’ve built, but the values I bring to every project: clean design, responsive layouts, accessible interfaces, and purposeful functionality.

My focus is on building real-world solutions through a modern tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and Node.js. I’ve also worked with tools like Puppeteer for backend automation — for example, a certificate generation system for my tech institute.

🧠 What You’ll Find Here Client Websites: Fully designed and developed websites for real clients like Data Insight Solutions Ltd, crafted to be visually stunning, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate.

Institutional Projects: My ongoing work on the Elora Tech Institute (ETI) website, a platform that reflects my mission to build a hybrid (online + physical) tech academy serving learners from beginner to professional levels.

Teaching Tools & Platforms: As a mentor and course instructor, I’ve designed systems and environments that support student learning, including automated certification tools and structured curriculum delivery.

Creative & Branding Work: Beyond code, I also develop branding assets, rebranded CVs, PDF documents, and full ad concepts that help startups and individuals communicate their identity online.

🚀 Technologies I Use Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express (learning), Puppeteer

CMS: WordPress

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Design Tools: Canva, Figma (light use), Adobe tools (where needed)

🌍 My Vision I believe in tech as a tool for empowerment — whether I’m teaching students, helping clients establish a digital presence, or working on platforms that serve communities. My long-term goal is to scale Elora Tech Institute into a global platform offering structured tech education to all age groups, from crèche to postgraduate.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, my skills, and my belief that every project — no matter how small — deserves excellence, purpose, and beauty.
